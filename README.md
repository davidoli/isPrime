# isPrime
8 Weeks of Code coding Challenge.

### Challenge Spec:
Create a simple browser app that allows the user to enter a number, and then press a button to learn if that number is prime.  The app’s main activity should have the following: 1.) A field for the user to enter a number. 2.)  A button for the user to press. 3.) An output field that displays whether or not the entered number is a prime number. 4.) The app should not crash if the user enters something other than a number.  It should behave gracefully, perhaps by preventing the user from entering non-numeric characters, or showing an error message if it couldn’t understand the input. 
  
If the user enters a 2, 3, 5, or 7, the app should display “Yes” or “True” or something similar.  If the user enters a 4, 9, or 15, the app should display “No” or “False” or something similar. 
### To Use:
Type a number in the first field under "Input Number Below:" and click on the "Calculate" button.  The "Result:" field will display whether or not the user-inputted number is prime or not.
